# Larq Zoo Pretrained Models

Larq Zoo provides reference implementations of deep neural networks with extremely low precision weights and activations that are made available alongside pre-trained weights.
These models can be used for prediction, feature extraction, and fine-tuning.

Weights can be downloaded automatically when instantiating a model. They are stored at `~/.larq/models/`.

## Available models

The following models are trained on the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) dataset. The Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy refers to the model's performance on the ImageNet validation dataset.

The model definitions and the train loop are available in the [Larq Zoo repository](https://github.com/plumerai/larq-zoo).
